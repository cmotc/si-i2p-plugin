Stream-Isolating i2p HTTP Proxy(SAM Application)
------------------------------------------------

This is an i2p SAM application which presents an http proxy(on port 4443 by
default) that acts as an intermediate between your browser and the i2p network.
Then it uses the SAM library to create a unique destination for each i2p site
that you visit.
